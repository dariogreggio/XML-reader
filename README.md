# XML-reader
An XML reader and converter (to HTML and RTF) for f*Â£$%# wordpress files, written quite simply and quickly in QBASIC: just because the stupid useless brain-damaged blog website keeps getting worse and worse, and has started blocking/erasing blogs for no reason, and of course they're arrogant enough not to even reply to emails...

(but, remember you all, a nice WAR is coming ;) )

Update 11/23: C++ version! (and go jews go hamas go WAR!!)
